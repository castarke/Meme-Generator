# Group Project: Who, Where, Wow!

## App Description

A movie recommendation application that narrows down movie choices and presents those titles with streaming platform options for the user to select and save into their watch list

## About the Project

For our first group project, we decided to build a simple recommendation app that would help an indecisive and/or exhausted user to select and watch movies.

## User Story

```
AS AN exhausted bootcamp student suffering from decision fatigue at the end of a long day of studying
I WANT to see a short list of recommended movies starring a particular actor
AND I WANT to see only those titles which are available streaming platforms I currently subscribe to
AND I WANT TO save titles, along with a direct link to their respective streaming platforms, to my watch list
SO THAT I can quickly select movies without endlessly scrolling through menus and searching multiple platforms
SO THAT I can click on one title and have it take me directly to its streaming option
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an movie recommendation dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I select my streaming platform choices and
WHEN I search for an actor
THEN I am presented with a short list of movie options starring that actor
WHEN I view those movie options
THEN I am presented with the movie poster, the year of release, an average user rating, a streaming platform option, and a "save" button
WHEN I click on the "save" button for a movie option
THEN I am presented with an addition in my watch list of the selected movie title and the title is linked to its feature page on my chosen streaming platform
WHEN I click on a linked movie title in my watch list
THEN I am presented with a new window on my chosen streaming platform displaying my movie selection
WHEN I click on an actor name in my search history
THEN I am again presented with the short list of movie options starring that actor
```
