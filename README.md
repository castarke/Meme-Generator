# Group Project #1: Team Awesome #3

## User Story

Users with decision fatigue
Users who like...

### DISCOVERY TOOL

### RANDOMIZER

to help choose movies (randomizer?)
find streaming options (free platforms)
give additional info about movies, RIYL, related actors, directors, etc.
movie ratings (Rotten Tomatoes e.g.)
Runtime
Genre
Year of release
Keanu/no keanu
locations of filming/setting (tie in with maps api)
movie budget (indie, blockbuster)

### SEARCH FUNCTION

user input ==> movie title?
user prompt ==> ask what specific(s) to filter

- limit with pull-down menu options (similar to library of congress example)

### WHAT GETS STORED IN LOCAL STORAGE

Recommendations based on user input
Users "saved" watch list

### FEATURES WE WANT TO UTILIZE

Drag & Drop features

- filter criteria (instead of pull-down menu)
- save to watch list

### FLAIR (bonus ideas if we have time!)

Sidebar with trivia (fun fact on this day -- use Day.js)

## Acceptance Criteria

use at least 2 APIs (get titles from OMDb, then get streaming platforms from watchmode)
